Points for future conversation. 
Some of the points were originally dismissed as it was too early to answer before completing PoC but we need to get to the bottom of these to form an option.

======

Dear colleagues,

I'm aware that you making progress on your PoC for Kafka.
As a preparation for discussion of identified solutions I'd like to offer a few points for our future conversation


- Data security
    - https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=CVTF&title=Management+of+SNC+data+in+IaaS+and+PaaS
    - https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/display/CVTF/Technical+guide+to+implement+encryption+for+SNC+on+AWS
    - https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/display/CVTF/Outsourcing+Principles

    - does the solution offer encription solution compatible with requirements of EC (see PaaS vs Saas requirements)
    - will all client applications run on single KMS Key (above)
    - is centralised cluster optimial solution /or farm of separate instances should be considered/
    - how practical is allowing access to encryption key to all client systems (how access controlls are managed/automated) (note that both publisher and consumer systems need to have access to Key(s))
        - possibly large number of dev systems will have permission to prod Key(s)!
        - possibly much simpler with a farm of smaller/dedicated instances, however consider cost impact and other provider limitations
            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-limits-endpoints.html
            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html

    - [!] clarify if SNC can transmited through the solution
        - we recommend a separate study to understand if proposed solution is valid (client & Laurent, experience with SNC)
        
    - CloudHSM - there is an intention to use solution provided by by DIGIT (over dedicated instance)
        - please share practical expriences from this excercise
        - clarify what client application need to use the system (is separate acceess to HSM required?)
        - will DIGIT HSM grant access to Key to Confulent AWS ?
        

- DC & Networking

    - does solution require Security Conventions from clients in DC ([Charles?]possibly all connection from DC will be covered by single approval)
    - does solution require Security Conventions from clients in AWS ([Charles?]yes, if EC TGW required for cross account access!)
    - is it practical to require Security Convention, from Kafka but also all client applications in the Cloud (assume DC clients covered by single approval)
    - is it practical to require Security Convention for Dev/Text access
    - can service be access via DNS name (in other VPCs), how its managed

    - [Charles] 
        - interconnections to other AWS accounts - are these visibile at all?
        - security convention link [?]

    - connectivity between AWS accounts on TransitGateway - overlapping CIDRs
    - can use alternative VPN connection or PrivateLink or another solution decicated to interconnections?

    - consider PrivateLink for re-use in AWS [?]


- Purchasing options

    The team intended to explore both PaaS and Saas solutions, ideally looking to let Confulent manage Kafka cluster for the Commission. However AWS Marketplace also offers a way to provision Kafka from as Confulent provided product (as Markepltace application).

    - [Recommendation] From a broker perspective - strong preference for PaaS:
        - [problem 1] how to do chargeback/billing per client from centralized solution

    - [Recommendation] Consider billing implications for the solution
        - easy to provision?
        - easy to bill?
        - clear cost split between clients?
        - can cost be controlled - scaling options - up and down?


    - when PaaS - AWS Marketplace instance provided by Confluent
        - https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/display/CVTF/Cloud+Marketplaces
            - " always perform its own Data Protection risk analysis before using a Marketplace solution"

    - when SaaS - Instance managed by Confluent
        - https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/display/CVTF/Requesting+SaaS
        - https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/display/ITProcurement/SaaS+and+security
            - SaaS questionaire (link: GeSLA Annex 2 - SaaS questionnaire template-v1.2.zip)
            - Saas Checklist

    - requirement for DPIA
        - is it realistic to complete DPIA on behalf of all clients




- Usability 
    - how to allow clients to see their 'partition'
        - monitoring metrics
        - security settings / encryption keys
        - how client manage their access

    - assuming therare per account resources (TGW routing, security groups, IAM roles)
        - how are these distributed and delivered to clients (i.e. paramterised CloudFormation stacks)
        - how these are versioned, any updates managed (consider versioned IaC templates, Private Marketplace or Service Catalog)

    - any known other limitations?
        - ???

    - latency results (one of PoC objectives)
        - acceptable?
        - comparision Saas vs PaaS solutions

    - [!] confirm ports connectivity for Kafka
    - kafka connect

    - is there a need for hub and spoke topology?

Dear Team,

Thank you for the participation in the meeting on Kafka deployment in AWS (25/07).
After digesting my notes and debrief with members of my team I'd like to make following comments.

We discussed:

- a need to create new dedicated AWS account for this project
all details required for an account request: https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/display/CVTF/Requesting+a+new+account+or+subscription+in+the+cloud

- a requirement to deploy in a new account a shared VPC for Kafka (and other services in future)
deployment of Confluent Cloud product and access from Commission's AWS accounts
 

Main objectives for PoC
 
- get experience with Kafka cluster provided through PrivateLink
- work out best approach for SNC in cloud (Kafka in EC managed VPC vs CC VPC)
measure latency 


I'd like to make following suggestions:
- Particular attention needs to be paid to handling SNC data in a context of centralised cluster in the cloud,
in particular when running AWS marketplace product in EC network vs managed by 3rd party as SaaS. 
We recommend dedicated session for this topic with SNC focused colleagues.

More resources:
https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=CVTF&title=Management+of+SNC+data+in+IaaS+and+PaaS

- Terms and Conditions in Confluent Cloud - In case of Marketplace product, AWS T&C superseded by CC T&C and its a responsibility of system owner to validate them against requirements of the Commission. 
It must be understood that by default it's rarely the case.

More resources:
https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/display/CVTF/Cloud+Marketplaces

- We can offer dedicated session for DC connectivity with C1 connectivity focused colleagues if required.

It's worth considering VPC & PrivateLink limitations in particular in the context of accessing 'shared VPC' from other AWS accounts.
This may require further clarifications, but I want to put it on the radar at this point.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-limits-endpoints.html
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html

In particular - multiple PrivateLinks may need to be considered for VPCs with overlapping CIDRs.




Looking forward to our future conversation on this topic.
