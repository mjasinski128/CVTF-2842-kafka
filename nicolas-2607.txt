=====

- Kafka operated Confluent Cloud will be considered as PaaS (ordered through AWS Marketplace)
    - client is responsible for ensuring CC T&C is compatible with Commissions requirements (usually not by default)

- SNC as it stands can not be transmited through CC
    - we recommend a separate study to understand if proposed solution is valid (one client & Laurent , epxrience with SNC)
    - 


- Recommendations
    - we recommend planning for more distributed soultion/ cluster per client/ per use case
    - problem 1: how to do chargeback/biling per client from centralized solution
    - 

- Other points
    - use native cloud products? MSK / Kinesis
    - C2 rarely operates service for other institutions
    - plan to connect azure
    - SNC questionaire for centralized solution
